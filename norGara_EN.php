                In 2022, Iraitz Guisado and Ane Soto founded IA Market with a clear goal: to give used mobile phones a
                second life and reduce the environmental impact of electronic devices.
            <p class="historia">

                The two friends observed that millions of phones were discarded each year, even though many could be
                repaired and reused. With this idea in mind, they created IA Market, a company that buys, repairs, and
                sells second-hand or refurbished mobile phones at affordable prices.</p>
            <p class="historia">
                Iraitz, an expert in hardware, used his curiosity about hardware and software to quickly diagnose issues
                with devices and optimize repairs. Ane, experienced in sustainability, took charge of creating a
                business model based on the principles of a circular economy.</p>
            <p class="historia">
                Today, IA Market not only offers mobile phones at lower prices but also helps reduce electronic waste
                and promotes more responsible consumption. Each phone sold is a step towards a more sustainable
                future.<br>

                At IA Market, our mission is clear: to reduce the environmental impact of technology by giving used
                mobile phones a new life. We buy, repair, and sell refurbished devices to promote more responsible and
                accessible consumption.</p>
            <p class="helburuak">
                We believe in a circular economy, where products can be reused instead of ending up as electronic waste.
                Additionally, we work to make technology more accessible to everyone by offering high-quality mobile
                phones at fair prices, all while contributing to a more sustainable future.
